This is a test file that I plan to move to the remote machine. I will also use it to 
practice my vi editing.

Here is a pointless sentence that maybe I can move or remove later.

I'm going to write something longer now. It will extend multiple lines, if I can 
come up with enough material. I am trying to manually force a right margin so that 
my text doesn't run to long off to the side. It's a bit hard because there are no 
guides. So I suspect that after a while of doing this there will be some drift to 
it.

# Here we have a comment over some fake code
if var1==6
    do thing
elseif var1>6
    do other thing
end

# The above is written in Matlab syntax. I can't remember how Python syntax works - 
# probably something good to refresh on. Note that I needed a second '#' to continue
# this train of thought. Now a third.

This file now seems long enough to play with, but still small enough to quickly move
with scp. Why did I not comment this part? No one knows.
